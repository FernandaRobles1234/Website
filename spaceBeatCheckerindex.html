				<h2>Motivation</h2>

				<p>
					SpaceBeat Checker is the result of a 3 month production for the "Develop at Ubisoft 2023" program. The prompt we were given for this challenge was: a 1 button game with the theme of "crowded spaces".
				</p>

				<p>
					Combos in fighting games are intricately linked to the precise timing and sequence of button presses and they were an inspiration to
					use timing in SpaceBeat Checker to unblock different actions.
					Players need to master not just the correct order of moves but also the exact timing needed to chain these moves seamlessly.
					With rhythm, a natural awareness of timing will welcome the players to unlock a multitude of actions using a single button, adding a layer of depth and strategy to gameplay.
				</p>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					Short productions and rhythm games come with their own set of challenges. We also had to create with the limitation of not using an engine,
					but with the tools of a given API.
				</p>

				<p>
					Managing rhythm without the proper tools haves some limitations. The computer's counters are relative and they wont necessarly be coherent with the
					song they are linked to given that song's usually play in a different thread.


				</p>


				<h2>Node Class Architecture</h2>

				<p>
					I inmediatly took a naive inpiration from Godot's Node structure because I like it. It is a really intuitive way to easily control the
					information of objects that are linked, given that a parent node will be given the responsability to manage it. The information that will be
					shared is mainly spatial information, like position, scale, etc.

					Some of the nodes I implemented can be seen in Fig.1.

						<figcaption>Fig.1 - Node class hierarchy.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</center>


				<ul>
					Nodes:
					<li>Will always have a transform component.</li>
					<li>Will always be renderable.</li>
					<li>Will always transfer its transform component to its children.</li>
					<li>Will always transfer its update calls.</li>
					<li>Will always transfer its render calls.</li>
					<li>Will always do memory management of their children upon destruction.</li>

					Limitations:
					<li>Only one child per type is allowed.</li>
					<li>Systems processing can't transfer beyond the most immediate generation of children. (As seen in Fig.2)</li>


				</ul>

				<h2>Song Node class</h2>

				<p>
					After ensuring the song was in the right buffer frecuancy: To tackle the timer coherence problem, we analized the drift between a computer's timer and a human tracking song's timer (us pressing to the apparent beat of the song)
					as seen in Fig.4.
				</p>

				<center>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/imagesSpaceBeatChecker/picDrift.png" alt="" style="width:80%">
						<figcaption>Fig.4 - Drift between computer's beat count and the song's beat count.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</center>

				<p>
					As we calculated the time drift as (Song's count - Computer's count), and the difference is dominantly positive, we can conclude the song's count is delaying in comparaison to the computer's count.
				</p>

				<p>
					But hope is not lost! We can also identify, at the beggining of the song the drift is almost negligable within the range of 0 s and 40 s! If we simulate a loop within this range,
					we find the results from Fig.5.
				</p>

				<center>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/imagesSpaceBeatChecker/picCorrectedDrift.png" alt="" style="width:80%">
						<figcaption>Fig.5 - Corrected Drift.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</center>
				<p>
					These results indicate that the margin of error is probably introduced by the human factor (the song's count is produced by us).
				</p>
				<p>
					With this information, we took the following design desition, we'll keep the song tracks within a range of 0 s to 16 s, and loop over them. This way, we can reinitialize counters
					and profit from the fact that at the beggining, the drift is really small.

					This means that each song will need it's own counter so we can maximize coherence between them.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Song Node is not an Entity Node, because it behaves differently. They can't be processed with the same systems, althought they share some behaviors given their Node natrue.
