				<h1>Stacking Success: Introduction to Game Development Using Tetris</h1>
				<p>
					Fueled by my passion for C++ and the urge to learn more, I've stepped into the vibrant world of video game development.
					What intrigues me the most is the diversity of problems we can tackle due to the virtual nature of video games.
					This field truly offers a playground for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of software development,
					since various approaches at different levels stand out more here than in other domains.
				</p>

				<p>
					With a surge of enthusiasm, I took on my first game project, which, as you can discern, is Tetris!

				</p>

				<p>
					And my aim is to bring you along on my journey &#128512; and convey the approachability I experienced during this introduction.
				</p>

				<h2>Tetris</h2>
				<p>
					Explain problematic.
				</p>

				<h2>Lets get started</h2>
				<p>
					In this tutorial, I'll be walking you through the process of creating an interactive application using Visual Studio
					in object-oriented programming. To facilitate the development, we'll use
					the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), a library to
					give developers intimate, low-level access to elements such as audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics.
					But what's development without robust testing? Hence, we'll adopt a debugging-oriented approach throughout.
					Dive in and let's begin this exciting journey!

				</p>
				<p>
					I won't be talking about how to install SLD, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13AEnd8XB70&ab_channel=TheInteractiveStudio">here</a> is the video where I learned!
				</p>


				<h2>Implementation design</h2>
				<p>
					Designing our game is the foundational step. It sets the stage because all the programming
					will revolve around it. Given that Tetris is a widely-analyzed challenge,
					many solutions have been proposed over the years. One of the most straightforward methods to
					tackle it is by writing the code in-line, leading to a single file for our entire project.
				</p>
				<p>
					We won't be taking that route. Instead, we'll prepare for an industry that's
					predominantly Object-Oriented. This is a complex programming subject; however,
					I believe this implementation does a good job of keeping it simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					And, once you get the hang of it, you'll find there's
					a comprehensive methodology underlying Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) that can truly make our life easier as programmers.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Steps</h3>

					<p>
						The following list outlines some of the most basic tasks a game can entail. Organized sequentially, it ensures that our
						progression through each task remains independent of subsequent ones. This structure guarantees that even if we pause at any stage,
						we'll have a somewhat complete exercise to reflect upon and showcase &#128578;
					</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<ol>
									<li>Set up your development.</li>
									<li>Game Initialization.</li>
									<li>Basic Gameboard.</li>
									<li>Tetromino implementation.</li>
									<li>Game Logic.</li>
									<li>User input.</li>
									<li>Game flow.</li>
								</ol>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						There are also some steps that could lead to a more polished result, but I haven't explored them myself. Some examples:
					</p>


					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<ul>
							<li>Polishing.</li>
							<li>User Interface.</li>
							<li>Testing iteration.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

				</section>

				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<h3>1. Set up your environment.</h3>

				<p>
					After we install SDL as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13AEnd8XB70&ab_channel=TheInteractiveStudio">here</a>, we can confirm with the following snippet that we can use it.
				</p>

				<pre><code class='cpp'>

	////////////////// Main.cpp /////////////////////
	#include &lt;SDL.h&gt;

	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
		// Initialize SDL
		if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {
		printf("SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
		}

	return 0;
	}

</code></pre>
